# Idris Nemsia
# This file loads a trained Siamese Neural Network model and evaluates it using
# one-shot learning on the Olivetti Faces dataset (Dataset used during training, unseen classes). 
# It tests the modelâ€™s ability to recognize 10 unseen individuals using just one random  
# example per identity each trial.
